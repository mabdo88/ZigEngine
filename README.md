# ZigEngine

A custom 3D game engine written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), built on a modern **Vulkan 1.3** renderer and a data-oriented **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**.

ZigEngine started life as a C++ project and was rewritten in Zig for its simplicity, explicit control over memory, and first-class C interop. It is the foundation for an in-development game with its own Game Design Document — the current focus is getting the core engine systems solid before gameplay work begins.

> **Naming:** the engine is **ZigEngine**; the game being built on it is **Strife**, an isometric ARPG (hero-tier entities are **Emenders**, horde enemies are **Knaves**). These product names appear in the [`ecs-research/`](ecs-research/) module.

> **Status:** early / pre-alpha. The renderer loads glTF and OBJ models with PBR materials, draws directional-light shadows with PCF filtering, hot-reloads shaders on save, and scenes can be hot-swapped at runtime; the ECS drives a priority-ordered system pipeline with delta-time updates, entity hierarchy/parenting, GPU-skinned skeletal animation (blend trees + state machines), Jolt-powered physics (collision, raycasts, character controller, triggers), JSON-defined prefabs with a spawner system, and scene save/load. APIs change frequently (see [Platform support](#platform-support)).

## Features

- **Vulkan 1.3 renderer** using dynamic rendering (`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`) — no render passes or framebuffers.
- **Sparse-set ECS** with generational entity handles, type-safe component storage, and a multi-component query iterator.
- **Priority-ordered system pipeline** — systems are declared as `SystemDesc` entries in `all_systems.zig` and managed by `SystemManager`, which handles `create`/`destroy` lifecycle and runs `update(dt)` in ascending-priority order each frame.
- **Scene management** — scenes are config-driven entities; press `1` / `2` at runtime to hot-swap between the Duck and House scenes. Active scene unload/load is handled by `SceneSystem` with `SceneActiveTag` / `ScenePendingTag` markers.
- **Event bus** — decoupled pub/sub for `entity_destroyed` and `scene_unloaded` events, used by the render system to clean up GPU resources.
- **Input system** — GLFW keyboard/mouse input polled each frame; drives scene switching and fly-camera controls (right-mouse-drag look, WASD movement).
- **Movement system** — delta-time-based animation (e.g. rotating the duck model).
- **Fly camera** — right-mouse-button mouse-look with pitch clamping and WASD movement at a fixed speed, integrated into `CameraSystem` via `shared_state`.
- **Config-driven initialization** — window properties, camera defaults, and scene list are declared in `config.zig`.
- **Delta-time update loop** — `Engine.run` computes frame delta time and passes it to `World.update`.
- **glTF model loading** via [`cgltf`](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) (positions, normals, UVs, indices, PBR base-color textures, node transforms).
- **Texture loading** via [`stb_image`](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
- **Bindless textures** — textures live in a single descriptor array indexed by a push-constant slot.
- **Texture caching & deduplication** — `RenderSystem` caches uploaded textures by material ID; GPU textures are reset on scene unload.
- **Batched GPU uploads** — `UploadBatch` in `upload.zig` records multiple buffer/image transfers into a single command buffer submission.
- **GPU memory management** through [Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator).
- **Modular renderer** — device selection, swapchain, pipeline, upload, and material/texture management are split into separate files under `src/renderer/`.
- **Slang shaders** compiled to SPIR-V.
- **Depth buffering**, per-frame uniform buffers, and double-buffered frames in flight.
- **Leak-checked allocation** in debug builds via Zig's `DebugAllocator`, with Vulkan validation layers enabled automatically in debug mode.
- **Allocation-error-safe ECS** — `errdefer` rollback in component storage and registry; generation-overflow slot retirement prevents entity ID reuse collisions.
- **Background scene preloading** — non-active scenes load on a background thread; GPU uploads are deferred to the main thread and gate scene activation until complete.
- **Cross-system shared state** — `shared_state.zig` exposes globals (window pointer, aspect ratio, fly-camera input) to systems without explicit wiring.
- **Directional lighting & shadow mapping** — Blinn-Phong diffuse + ambient lighting; a 2048×2048 depth-only shadow map with 3×3 PCF filtering, rendered via dynamic rendering with sync2 barriers.
- **Entity hierarchy** — `setParent`/`clearParent` with cycle- and orphan-safe `FinalTransformComponent` propagation up the parent chain via `HierarchySystem`.
- **OBJ model loading** — fan-triangulated `objLoader.zig` parser (v/vn/vt/f, attribute-triple dedup, negative indices), routed through the same scene pipeline as glTF; materials loaded from a sibling JSON file via `materialLoader.zig`.
- **Bindless material buffer** — a single `StructuredBuffer<MaterialData>` (metallic/roughness/albedo index) indexed by push constant, parallel to the bindless texture array.
- **Shader hot reload** — `hotreload.zig` watches `.spv` files on a background thread (debounced) and recreates pipelines in place when shaders change, without an app restart.
- **Async asset manager** — generic `AssetManager(T)` with generational handles, ref counting, path dedup, and background-thread loading with `unloaded`/`loading`/`ready`/`failed` states.
- **INI-driven config overlay** — `strife.ini` overlays window size, vsync, and validation-layer settings onto `Config.default` via a hand-rolled `ini.zig` parser.
- **`std.Io`-based platform layer** — timer, filesystem, job system, and UUID generation (`timer.zig`, `fs.zig`, `jobs.zig`, `uuid.zig`) built on Zig master's `std.Io` abstraction rather than the now-removed `std.time`/`std.fs.cwd()`/`std.Thread` primitives.
- **Skeletal animation** — glTF skin/animation import, GPU vertex skinning (bindless skin-matrix buffer, up to 4 joints/vertex), an `AnimPlayer` sampler with TRS keyframe interpolation (lerp + slerp), 1D blend trees, an animation state machine with blended transitions, and keyframe animation events delivered through the `EventBus`.
- **Physics via Jolt** — collision (static/dynamic boxes synced into `TransformComponent`), raycasts (single + multi-hit), a `CharacterVirtual`-based character controller with gravity/jump, sensor triggers re-emitted as `EventBus` events, and a fixed collision-layer matrix (static/player/enemy/projectile/trigger).
- **Prefabs & spawning** — JSON-defined prefabs (`assets/prefabs/*.json`) loaded into a `PrefabRegistry` and instantiated by mesh/material asset path (single entity or parent+children for multi-primitive assets); `SpawnPointComponent` periodically spawns prefab instances up to a cap and self-corrects its active count via the `EventBus`.
- **Scene save/load** — UUID-tagged spawn points and prefab instances round-trip to/from JSON; static glTF/OBJ scene geometry is reconstructed by re-running the existing preload pipeline rather than being re-serialized.

## Architecture

The engine is organized around an ECS core with a priority-ordered system pipeline. `Engine` is generic over a `WorldType` (currently `VulkanWorld`), owning the allocator and running the main loop.

## Recent Improvements

- **SystemManager lifecycle**: Replaced `SystemRunner` with `SystemManager` that manages `create`/`destroy` lifecycle. Systems are declared as `SystemDesc` entries in `all_systems.zig`; `SystemCreateCtx` passes allocator, registry, and config to each system's `create_fn`. Create order is descending priority (Render first), destroy is reverse create order.
- **Fly camera controls**: Right-mouse-button mouse-look with pitch clamping and WASD movement. `InputSystem` captures mouse/keyboard state into `shared_state.fly_cam`; `CameraSystem` applies movement at 10 units/second. Window gained `getMouseButton`, `getCursorPos`, `setCursorMode`.
- **Background scene preloading**: Non-active scenes load on a background thread via `SceneSystem`. GPU uploads are deferred to the main thread and gate scene activation until complete, eliminating stalls on scene switch.
- **Cross-system shared state**: `shared_state.zig` exposes globals (window pointer, aspect ratio, `FlyCamInput`) to systems without explicit constructor wiring.
- **Allocation-error-safe ECS**: `errdefer` rollback in `ComponentStorage.attachComponent` and throughout `zvulkanSystem.init`. Generation-overflow slot retirement in `Registry.destroyEntity` prevents entity ID reuse collisions at max generation.
- **UploadBatch error safety**: Added `errdefer` cleanup for staging buffers and `cancel()` method for error-path disposal.
- **Scene management system**: Config-driven scene entities with runtime hot-swapping. `SceneSystem` handles loading glTF scenes, spawning mesh entities with `SceneOwnedComponent`, and unloading the previous scene's entities. Press `1` / `2` to switch between Duck and House scenes.
- **Event bus**: Added `EventBus` with `subscribe` / `emit` for decoupled communication. The render system subscribes to `scene_unloaded` to reset textures, and `entity_destroyed` triggers GPU mesh cleanup.
- **Input system**: `InputSystem` polls GLFW keyboard/mouse state each frame and requests scene switches by tagging scene entities with `ScenePendingTag`.
- **Movement system**: Delta-time-based `MovementSystem` rotates the duck model's `TransformComponent` yaw at 90°/second.
- **Config-driven initialization**: Engine config (window title/size, camera defaults, scene list) is declared in `config.zig` and consumed by `VulkanWorld.init`.
- **Delta-time update loop**: `Engine.run` computes frame delta time via GLFW and passes it through `SystemManager.update` to all systems.
- **Renderer modularization**: Split the monolithic renderer into `device.zig`, `swapchain.zig`, `pipeline.zig`, `upload.zig`, and `material.zig`.
- **Batched GPU uploads**: `UploadBatch` records multiple buffer/image transfers into a single command buffer for fewer submission stalls.
- **Texture caching & deduplication**: `RenderSystem` caches uploaded textures by material ID to avoid re-uploading shared textures. GPU textures are reset on scene unload via the event bus.
- **Transform system overhaul**: `BakedTransformComponent` preserves full glTF transforms while `TransformComponent` provides local overrides. A dedicated `TransformSystem` recomputes `FinalTransformComponent = baked × local` once per frame; the renderer just reads it instead of redoing the multiply itself.
- **GPU mesh refcounting**: `RenderSystem.attachMesh` with reference-counted `GpuMesh` pointers prevents double-free when multiple entities share the same mesh.
- **Type-safe glTF node access**: `NodeView` adapter struct replaces `anytype`-based C pointer access in the glTF loader.

> This list covers the renderer/ECS-foundation era (M0–M3). Animation (M4), physics (M5), and scene/prefabs/spawning (M6) landed afterward — see the per-task notes in `CLAUDE.md` for those.

## Requirements

- **Zig 0.16.0** (see `minimum_zig_version` in `build.zig.zon`).
- **Vulkan SDK 1.4.341.1** with a GPU/driver supporting Vulkan 1.3.
- A Slang compiler (only needed if you change the shaders; precompiled SPIR-V is committed).

## Building

```sh
# Build the executable
zig build

# Build and run
zig build run

# Run all tests (module + executable + ECS)
zig build test

# Run the GPU-free ECS unit tests only
zig build test-ecs

# Build with custom Vulkan SDK path
zig build -Dvulkan-sdk=/path/to/VulkanSDK/1.4.341.1

> **Heads up:** The Vulkan SDK path can be configured via:
> - The `--vulkan-sdk` build option: `zig build -Dvulkan-sdk=/path/to/VulkanSDK/1.4.341.1`
> - The `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable
> - Defaults to `../../../VulkanSDK/1.4.341.1/` if neither is set
>
> The build links OS-specific libraries: Windows uses vendored GLFW + Win32 libs (`gdi32`, `user32`, `shell32`, `vulkan-1`); Linux uses system GLFW + Vulkan loader; macOS uses system GLFW + Vulkan (MoltenVK) + Cocoa/IOKit/QuartzCore/Metal frameworks.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status                                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows  | Supported (primary development target)                             |
| Linux    | Partial — `zig build test-ecs`, `zig fmt`, and `zig ast-check` work; the full graphical build links against system GLFW + Vulkan loader |
| macOS    | Best-effort — build.zig includes GLFW + Vulkan (MoltenVK) + framework linking; untested |

## Roadmap

Milestones M0–M7 (foundation, ECS, assets, renderer, animation, physics, scene/prefabs/spawning, audio) are complete. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full per-task breakdown.
